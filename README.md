# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis

The project benchmarks multiple algorithms across different dataset types such as random, reverse-sorted, nearly sorted, and high-duplicate lists. To ensure precise performance measurement, the application employs multi-threading for parallel execution, implements timeout handling, logs execution times, and visualizes results using Matplotlib. The analysis provides valuable insights into computational complexity and real-world algorithm efficiency. This project enhanced expertise in algorithm optimization, performance benchmarking, and data visualization. 

This repository contains implementations of various sorting algorithms and scripts to measure their performance across different datasets.
